## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Crossmodal Perception and Plasticity laboratory ðŸ‘‹

What is the advantage of having multiple senses to sample the world? 

How does the brain integrate or segregate different sensory signals? 

What are the consequences of sensory deprivation for the mind and brain? 

Do blind people think differently about colors? What replaces voices or speech in deaf people?

In the CPP-lab, we are trying to address these questions and many more.
